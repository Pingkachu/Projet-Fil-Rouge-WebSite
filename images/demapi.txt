4. iPhone 6S

Bigger, better, sleeker and faster than the iPhone 6

OS: iOS 9 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 1334 x 750 | RAM: 2GB |Storage:16GB/64GB/128GB | Battery: 1,715mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP

What can you say about any new iPhone? Most people are already decided about whether they're going to buy the new model before it's even announced - but that hasn't stopped us giving it a thoroughly good going over.

The good points are the same as usual: a hugely powerful phone, a great camera and the new 3D Touch interface is genuinely useful, and will only continue to get better as time goes on.


10. Sony Xperia Z5 Premium

The world's first 4K screen in a phone - with some amazing bits bolted on too

OS: Android 5.1 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 5520 ? 4140 | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32GB | Battery: 3,430mAh | Rear camera: 23MP | Front camera: 5.1MP

Look, we know it's got a 4K screen. And yes, we know that sounds a bit mental. But trust us when we say that it's not as ludicrous as it sounds.

It's a brilliant display - there's nothing more pin-sharp on the market at 806ppi density. We're not convinced you'll be able to SEE those extra pixels, and they're not turned on all the time, but it's there.



8. Nexus 6P

Google goes again for a phablet, and it's a corker

OS: Android 6 | Screen size: 5.7-inch | Resolution: 2560 x 1440 | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32GB/64GB/128GB | Battery: 3,450mAh | Rear camera: 12.3MP | Front camera: 8MP

The bigger of the two new Nexus phones is a phone that can entice you in many ways. Perhaps you'll like the vivid QHD display, which is more compact this year to offer a sharper resolution when watching movies or browsing the web.

Or the fact it'll get the latest version of Android first (currently the highly-rated Android Marshmallow) or the innovative placement of the fingerprint scanner on the back - which is both quick and accurate.


3. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge

OS: Android 5 | Screen size: 5.1-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | RAM: 3GB | Storage:32GB/64GB/128GB | Battery: 2560mAh | Rear camera: 16MP | Front camera: 5MP
